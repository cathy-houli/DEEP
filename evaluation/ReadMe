The results evaluation of RNA-seq aligners on simulated and real datasets.

Evaluation programs are writen by C-language and R-language, and applied to Linux environment. The workflow of evaluation will be demonstrated next.

1.Evaluation of simulated datasets on base-level and read-level

    Here we compare align results (SAM format) with simulated data answers. 

    [1] sort simulated data answer files and test align result files by name.

        sort -o answer.sread -k1,1 answer_file.cig
        sort -o test.sread -k1,1 test_file.sam

    [2] compile read-sta.c and run it.

        gcc -Wall -O0 -o stat_read stat_read.c
	./stat_read answer.sread test.sread

2.Evaluation of simulated datasets and real datasets on splice-level.

    Here we compare splice junctions extracted from simulated data answers and align results (SAM file).

    [1] extract splice junctions from gtf files.
        
        gcc -Wall -O0 -o gtf2splice gtf2splice.c
        ./gtf2splice reference.gtf ref.splice

        remove duplicate splice:
            sort ref.splice -k1,1 -k2,2n -k3,3n -o ref.sort.splice
            run splice_dup.R
            before run splice_dup.R need to change input file name and output file name
	
    [2] extract splice junctions from answer files.

        gcc -Wall -O0 -o read2splice read2splice.c
        ./read2splice answer.cig answer.splice a
        remove duplicate splice

    [3] extract splice junctions from align files.

        gcc -Wall -O0 -o read2splice read2splice.c
        ./read2splice test.sam test.splice r
        remove duplicate splice

    [4] compare align results splice junctions with answer splice junctions.
        
        gcc -Wall -O0 -o splice splice.c
        ./splice answer.sort.cov.splice answer.sort.cov.splice
